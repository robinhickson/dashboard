# project7
Final version

Project uses JS modules - so local file-protocol server will not function correctly. Needs 'live server', e.g. via VS Code extension.

Besides the important note above, some choices have been made by me to make the project a little more realistic and a lot more fun.
- content is loaded randomly from members' object
- alerts and notifications are combined when notifications icon is selected (but Alert Message can be tested separately as per instructions)
- the nav bar is in column when <768px viewport (just seems a waste of screen real estate below this)
- the autocomplete feature is a comparison checker, plus selecting an option then 'autocompletes' the search input
