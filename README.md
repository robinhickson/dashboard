# project7
Final version X



Some choices have been made by me to make the project a little more fun.
- content is loaded randomly from members' object
- alerts and notifications are combined when notifications icon is selected (but Alert Message can be tested separately as per instructions)
- the nav bar is in row when <768px viewport (just seems a waste of screen real estate below this), and narrow column above 767px
- the autocomplete feature is a comparison checker, plus selecting an option then 'autocompletes' the search input
